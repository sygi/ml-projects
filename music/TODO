try to fit linear regression / gaussian process, etc

regression:
- visualize social graph? - DONE
- find the distribution of data and make it more gaussian - known
- see the variance of user counts on different artists - DONE
- run multiple CV to observe variance of (estimated test) error. Save results to some file to be able to draw a boxplot at the end.
- use (stochastic) methods to reduce dimensionality
- try to clusterize the songs
- try something weighted by the social distance to different people
- try kNN
- try a slope one algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One)
- try a collaborative filtering algorithm from coursera video (how to set number of hidden variables?) (https://class.coursera.org/ml-005/lecture/100 and further)
- try to combine 2 types of information: user 'local' data and social information
